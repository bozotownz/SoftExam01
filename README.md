Run the tests with coverageas usual (this works out of the box).
./db/ folder holds different "database" files. These can be emptied (remove everything but the headers) in order to see the program working from a clean slate.

The actual program runs with running main as usual, and huba can be used to log in. If other users are needed, add them in the users.csv file with an empty password (passwords arent used).
