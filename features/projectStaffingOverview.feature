Feature: Project Staffing Overview
As a project leader
I want to view developer availability
So that I can effectively allocate team resources to activities

#Scenario: Check developer availability
#    Given I am logged in as a project leader
#    When I check the availability for week "2025-10-01" to "2025-10-07"
#    Then the system should display a list of developers and their current activity load for that week
